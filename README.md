# pandas-challenge

Assignment 4 of UCI's Data Visualization Program

A series of programs using Python, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebook to analyze data about schools, their students, and their test scores.

With this data, insights about how successful a given school is based on the metrics used can be drawn.


## About

The ipynb file in this repository will read the csv files in the 'Resources' folder, and return the following information:

* Names of all schools in a district
* Total number of students in each school
* Total budget of each school
* Average reading and math score of students, for each school and all schools
* Percentage of students who passed reading, math, and both subjects

Further comparison is made with this information, by comparing the type of school, the amount of budget a school spends on a student, etc.
